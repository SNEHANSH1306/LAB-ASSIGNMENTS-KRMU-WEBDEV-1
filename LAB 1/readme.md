🌐 Snehansh Jangir's Portfolio Website
    Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This website showcases my background, skills, and projects as a B.Tech CSE 
    (AI & ML) student and aspiring pilot. It's built using pure HTML and is designed to be simple, informative, and easy to 
    navigate.

    - Image Setup
    - Make sure the image file IMG-20250907-WA0026.jpg is placed inside an images folder.

    <img src="images/IMG-20250907-WA0026.jpg" alt="MY IMAGE" width="400px" height="500px">
    - This ensures the image loads correctly when the site is viewed locally or hosted.
