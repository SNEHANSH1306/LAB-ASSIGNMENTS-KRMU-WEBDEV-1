                <p>Hello!! <br><br>I’m Snehansh Jangir, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at K.R. Mangalam University.
                    Alongside my academic journey in tech, I’m also an aspiring pilot with a deep passion for aviation and aircraft systems.
                    My fascination with flight fuels my ambition to earn my wings in the near future.
                    <br><br>
                    On the tech front, I’m actively building my skills in web development, with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, Java, and Python.
                    I enjoy solving problems through code and continuously seek opportunities to grow as both a developer and a future aviator.
                </p>

                <h2>MY PROJECTS</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>MOVIE RECOMONDATION SYSTEM:</h4>
                        During my Class 12 studies, I developed a Movie Recommendation System using Python. <br>
                        This intelligent system analyzes user preferences and suggests movies based on their favorite genres.
                        It was my first hands-on experience with data-driven personalization, and it sparked my interest in building smart, user-centric applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>MENU MATE:</h4>
                        This application is designed to simplify weekly meal planning. Users can upload a weekly menu in PDF or JPEG format, and our smart AI system automatically processes the file to generate a clear, day-by-day meal layout.
                        In addition to displaying what's being cooked each day, the app also offers alternative recipe suggestions—perfect for those moments when you're craving something different or want to try a new dish.
                        <br>
                        Whether you're managing a household kitchen, a cafeteria, or just organizing your personal meals, this app makes planning and cooking more efficient and enjoyable.

                        <h4>PORTFOLIO WEBSITE:</h6>
                        Recently, I created a personal portfolio website that showcases detailed information about me—my background, interests, projects, and skills. 
                        It’s designed to be easily shareable, allowing anyone with the link to explore and learn more about who I am and what I do.
